c)	The Destination column identifies the destination network.
    The Gateway column identifies the defined gateway for the specified network. The 0.0.0.0 means that the network is locally connected on that interface and no more hops are needed to get to it.
    The Genmask column shows the netmask for the network.
    Under the Flags section, the U flag means the route is up.
    The Iface column shows the network interface.
    
    
    OUTPUT
   The output of the kernel routing table is organized in the following columns

   Destination
          The destination network or destination host.

   Gateway
          The gateway address or '*' if none set.

   Genmask
          The netmask for the destination net; '255.255.255.255' for a host destination and '0.0.0.0' for the default route.
          
   0.0.0.0 in Genmask means there is no mask
